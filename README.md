# Desktop Recorder App

This is the Electron UI for a desktop recorder app I worked on for a couple of
years as a hobby project. The C++ code for this project is found here: [Desktop Recorder Library](https://github.com/jgcoded/DesktopRecorderLibrary). The app reached 10K monthly active users on the Windows Store.

Here is a demo of what the app looked like.
